      "It didn't start with an ambulance. It started with a year of gaslighting.",
      "You were a good patient. You went to every appointment, even when you had to leave work early, bike two hours with your stomach in knots, or beg friends for rides. You tolerated it all ‚Äî the rotating cast of medical residents who never read your chart, the endless loop of 'eat more fiber,' 'take Miralax,' 'do yoga,' and the cherry on top: 'Are you here for drugs?'",
      "You told them, every time: 'This is NOT a case of IBS. I'm an ultramarathon runner. I eat like a vegan wellness influencer. I've taken everything you've prescribe - multiple times - as written. And I'm still in agony.'",
      "They nodded sympathetically and prescribed a different flavor of useless.",
      "You worked at a 3D printing company, finally with decent insurance. Stanford Hospital was twenty minutes away. The GI clinic was walking distance from your job. You thought that meant something.",
      "It didn't.",
      "Stanford gave you the same shrugs and suspicion that Medi-Cal did ‚Äî just with nicer furniture.",
      "After months of vomiting, bloating so severe none of your clothes fit, and appointments that went nowhere, you stopped hoping. You started surviving. You stayed late in the lab to make up for time lost to vomiting in your car or sprinting to the bathroom mid-client meeting. You popped antiemetics like mints ‚Äî which you'd been on since middle school, by the way, because this didn't start last year. This started decades ago. No one ever took it seriously.",
      "Rather than sympathy and help, fighting the urge not to throw up in the middle of meetings (and often failing) earned you the label of 'unreliable employee'. It's not long before your b*tch of a boss puts you on an extensive PIP for <gasp!> fighting a serious and life-threatening chronic illness.",
      "Then came the night everything broke.",
      "You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night. The pain is relentless ‚Äî twisting, bloating, pulsing ‚Äî and you can't tell if it's your intestines or a demon.",
      "But the pain ‚Äî the pressure ‚Äî it felt like you'd swallowed a basketball.",
      "You couldn't stand. Couldn't walk. Couldn't breathe without crying.",
      "The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can't walk. You're doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.",
      "The paramedics arrived. Professionals, supposedly.",
      "Your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you're not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you've swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight ‚Äî so tight you're surprised you don't burst into stretch marks.",
      "They try and fail to find a vein. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream. The bruising is immediate spreads like a Rorschach test. You wouldn't be able to lift your arm for weeks.",
      "And finally ‚Äî finally ‚Äî you arrive at the ER. Where you learned that the trauma of being believed isn't actually better than the trauma of being ignored.",
      "Welcome to the ER. Please take a number. And maybe a vomit bag."

      "Your partner and the paramedics are engaged in what can only be described as a medical debate club meeting about whether you're pregnant with twins. 'She's just bloated!' your partner insists, while the paramedics exchange knowing glances that say 'Ah yes, the classic \"just bloated\" cover story.'",
      "Meanwhile, they're trying to find a vein. Spoiler alert: they can't. After what feels like an eternity of poking and prodding, one of them sighs and pulls out a syringe. 'We'll have to go intramuscular,' they say, as if this is a perfectly normal thing to say to someone who is already in the worst pain of their life.",
      "The fentanyl hits bone. You scream. Not a polite 'ouch' scream, but the kind of scream that makes small children cry and dogs howl in sympathy. The bruising spreads like a Rorschach test of suffering, and you're pretty sure you'll never be able to lift your arm again.",
      "That's when you realize: if this is how they treat you in the ambulance, the ER is going to be a whole new level of hell. You make a decision.",
      "'I'm not going. Stop the ambulance. I want out.'",
      "There's a pause. Then a sigh. You're told you'll need to sign an Against Medical Advice (AMA) form before they can legally let you out. You scribble something between a middle finger and a squiggle and immediately regret it‚Äîbut not as much as you're about to regret everything else.",
      "They unload you and leave you curled like a shrimp on the cold curb outside your apartment building. You can't walk. You're in too much pain to even sit upright. A stray soda can rolls toward your shoe, taps it gently, and continues its journey with more dignity than you currently possess.",
      "The paramedics drive off, probably to argue with someone else about whether they're pregnant with triplets or just really into burritos."
