\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \uc0\u55357 \u57041  Scene: The Great Ambulance Escape\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You are, technically speaking, lying in an ambulance. But only barely. The moment you\'92re loaded up, things go sideways.\
The EMTs are arguing over your chart\'97or lack thereof\'97saying things like \'93chronic pain patient\'94 in that tone that\'92s practically a slur, and you catch the glint of a Benadryl-and-Ativan combo being prepped like you\'92re a nuisance to be sedated, not a patient to be helped.\
Then it happens. The older paramedic, who hasn\'92t made eye contact with you once, mutters:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93This might be behavioral. I mean, there\'92s no trauma.\'94\
You snap.\
\'93I\'92m not going. Stop the ambulance. I want out.\'94\
There\'92s a pause. Then a sigh. The ambulance pulls into a gas station. You\'92re told you\'92ll need to sign an 
\f2\i Against Medical Advice (AMA)
\f1\i0  form before they can legally let you out. You scribble something between a middle finger and a squiggle and immediately regret it\'97but not as much as you\'92re about to regret everything else.\
They unload you and leave you curled like a shrimp on the cold curb outside the convenience store. You can't walk. You\'92re in too much pain to even sit upright. A stray soda can rolls toward your shoe, taps it gently, and continues its journey with more dignity than you currently possess.\
You open your phone with trembling hands. And now comes the worst part: asking for help.\

\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 \strokec2 What now?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 \uc0\u55357 \u56985  
\f0\b Call an Uber
\f1\b0 \uc0\u8232 You brace yourself for the Everest-level challenge of getting into a car with roiling upper gastric pain, nausea, and the spinal flexibility of a mannequin. But worse\'97far worse\'97is the quiet heartbreak of watching your partner, 
\f0\b who can barely walk or sit
\f1\b0 , force himself into his own car to trail you.\
He can\'92t ride in an Uber; the seats are wrong, the angles are wrong, the world is wrong. His own car is tricked out with ergonomic cushions, special mirrors, and the faint scent of medicinal despair. He\'92ll follow you to the hospital. He\'92ll sit in the parking lot with a heat pad, probably crying silently, and you\'92ll pretend you don\'92t notice. But tomorrow\'97or next week, or forever\'97he\'92ll be down with a new flare. Maybe in his shoulders this time. Maybe his jaw. Maybe a brand-new \'93hot spot\'94 that never goes away.\
But hey\'97you got your ride.\
\uc0\u55357 \u56468  
\f0\b Ask your partner to drive you
\f1\b0 \uc0\u8232 You don\'92t want to. You 
\f2\i really
\f1\i0  don\'92t want to. But you call anyway, and he picks up after one ring, already worried. The drive is less than 15 minutes but feels like a death march.\
He helps you down the front steps, one arm trembling against yours, the other hand braced against the car door like he\'92s holding up a collapsing building. You watch the pain flicker across his face as he opens the passenger side. You try not to scream while folding your body into the seat. Both of you pretend you\'92re fine.\
By the time you get to the ER, he\'92s soaked in sweat and shaking. You try to reassure him. He nods.\
Neither of you believe it.\
