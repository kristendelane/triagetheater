      "It didn\u2019t start with an ambulance. It started with a year of gaslighting.",
      "You were a good patient. You went to every appointment, even when you had to leave work early, bike two hours with your stomach in knots, or beg friends for rides. You tolerated it all \u2014 the rotating cast of medical residents who never read your chart, the endless loop of \u201ceat more fiber,\u201d \u201ctake Miralax,\u201d \u201cdo yoga,\u201d and the cherry on top: \u201cAre you here for drugs?\u201d",
      "You told them, every time: \u201cThis is NOT IBS and I've never touched drugs in my life. I\u2019m an ultramarathon runner. I eat like a vegan wellness influencer. I take everything you prescribe as written. And I\u2019m still in agony.\u201d",
      "They nodded sympathetically and prescribed a different flavor of useless.",
      "You worked at a 3D printing company, finally with decent insurance. Stanford Hospital was twenty minutes away. The GI clinic was walking distance from your job. You thought that meant something.",
      "It didn\u2019t.",
      "Stanford gave you the same shrugs and suspicion that Medi-Cal did \u2014 just with nicer furniture.",
      "After months of vomiting, bloating so severe none of your clothes fit, and appointments that went nowhere, you stopped hoping. You started surviving. You stayed late in the lab to make up for time lost to vomiting in your car or sprinting to the bathroom mid-client meeting. You popped antiemetics like mints \u2014 which you\u2019d been on since middle school, by the way, because this didn\u2019t start last year. This started decades ago. No one ever took it seriously. Rather than sympathy or help, you're fight to make it through Zoom meetings with clients without throwing up on the table earned you the label of \"unreliable employee\" and your boss immediately put you on a PIP.",
      "Then came the night everything broke.",
      "You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night. The pain is relentless \u2014 twisting, bloating, pulsing \u2014 and you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s your intestines or a demon.",
      "But the pain \u2014 the pressure \u2014 it felt like you\u2019d swallowed a basketball.",
      "You couldn\u2019t stand. Couldn\u2019t walk. Couldn\u2019t breathe without crying.",
      "The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can\u2019t walk. You\u2019re doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.",
      "The paramedics arrived. Professionals, supposedly.",
      "Your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you\u2019re not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you\u2019ve swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight \u2014 so tight you\u2019re surprised you don\u2019t burst into stretch marks.",
      "They try and fail to find a vein. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream. The bruising is immediate and spreads like a Rorschach test. You wouldn\u2019t be able to lift your arm for weeks.",
      "And finally \u2014 finally \u2014 they brought you to the ER. Where you learned that the trauma of being believed isn\u2019t actually better than the trauma of being ignored.",
      "Welcome to the ER. Please take a number. And maybe a vomit bag."
