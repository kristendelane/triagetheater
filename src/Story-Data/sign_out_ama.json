      "The meds arenâ€™t helping. The call button may as well be connected to a black hole. You havenâ€™t been rounded on in three days.",
      "You ask for the AMA form. The nurse doesnâ€™t fight it. She just sighs and prints it out.",
      "You sign with a shaky hand, then begin the ritual: unplugging, untaping, unhooking. You dress yourself in a stained hoodie from the bottom of your ER go-bag and shove what remains of your dignity in your tote.",
      "Before leaving, you glance at the bin of unused supplies. You reach in and grab what you can â€” IV tubing, pulse ox clips, chucks pads â€” and shove them under the pile of trash, like a protest offering.",
      "They donâ€™t even notice when you leave. No one follows. No one checks. You disappear into the night like you were never there."
