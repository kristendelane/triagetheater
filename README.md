# Triage Theater
🧨 Triage Theater A snarky, choose-your-own-nightmare game about chronic illness, ER hellscapes, and the bureaucratic horror of trying not to die while everyone around you asks, “Have you tried Miralax?”  Built with React + JSON branching logic. Inspired by real medical trauma, TikTok chaos, and cats with better instincts than most doctors.
