Welcome to the ER: Take Please Number
You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night, a pain you know too well from your last visit to the ER — the cold, sterile room, the fluorescent lights humming overhead, and the constant, aching reminder that no one seems to believe you're actually suffering.
The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can’t walk. You’re doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.
When the paramedics arrive, your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you’re not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you’ve swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight — so tight you’re surprised you don’t burst into stretch marks.
They try and fail to find a vein. You tell them it’s always like this, that you need ultrasound guidance, but they insist they know what they’re doing. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream.
The bruising is immediate and deep. You won’t be able to lift your arm high enough to put on a shirt for a month.

Choice 1: The Decision to Stay Silent or Speak Out
You’re laying in the hallway, feeling the weight of the situation. The nurse’s dismissive attitude weighs on you. You wonder if you should speak up about your concerns, but you’re also tired of being labeled.
	•	Speak up: Tell the nurse that you need proper treatment, even if it means escalating the situation. (Go to Confrontation)
	•	Stay silent: You’re too exhausted to argue. You decide to wait it out, hoping someone might eventually care. (Go to Waiting Game)

Triage takes hours. You crochet a queen-sized blanket while waiting for a hallway gurney. You’re offered Tylenol, a lidocaine patch (for your stomach), and eye rolls. The pain is upper gastric spasms. The patch is for muscle pain. You tell them. They nod and hand you a psych eval form.
Eventually, someone wheels you off for abdominal X-rays. Standing up is nearly impossible, but no one seems to care. You’re hunched over in pain, clinging to the imaging table, and still get reprimanded for being dramatic. They’re looking for a small bowel obstruction, even though your chart says

Confrontation:
You speak up, demanding the treatment you deserve. This only escalates the situation further as the nurse starts treating you as difficult. Still, it’s a small victory as a doctor arrives sooner than expected. They don’t offer any solutions, but at least they listen. You get a diagnosis for some of your symptoms — a glimmer of hope amidst all the neglect.
	•	Choice: Ask for a supervisor to escalate the issue.Go to: Supervisor Escalation
	•	Choice: You give up and fall into a daze, hoping someone will just care enough to help.Go to: Discharged in Frustration

Waiting Game:
You lie there, ignored. The clock ticks slowly, and each minute feels like an hour. You wonder if anyone’s ever going to pay attention. You keep crocheting to distract yourself.
Hours later, the triage nurse finally walks by, muttering something about more tests, as they wheel you off for an abdominal X-ray. It doesn’t answer any questions, but at least you’re not alone anymore.
	•	Choice: Ask if the X-ray will give any useful information.Go to: The Answer That Never Comes
	•	Choice: You hold on, trying to believe that you’ll get real answers soon.Go to: A Glimmer of Hope

TikTok Moment:
In a moment of desperation, you decide to post a TikTok from your hospital bed. It’s the first time you’re seen — not by the staff, but by the world.
	•	Post it: You post the TikTok video, knowing it might go viral and get people talking about your experience.Go to: Viral Hit
	•	Delete it: You reconsider and decide not to share your pain with the world. It feels too raw.Go to: Private Suffering

Viral Hit:
The video explodes online. Thousands of people see your pain and frustration, empathizing with your situation. You become a voice for those who have suffered in silence. The comments pour in: "Same!" "I laughed so hard I aspirated my Ensure." The recognition is bittersweet, but it’s validation nonetheless.
You post another TikTok. Then another. They get darker. Funnier. More surreal. One features sock puppets reenacting your last blood draw. Another is just you deadpan lip-syncing to Billie Eilish while holding a sign that says “Guess how many days I’ve been NPO?”
Your social media following grows, and with it, the sense that you’re finally being seen.

TikTok Descriptions:
	1	“I am Blanket” TikTokTikTok Description:Filmed lying in your ER bed, you hold a crocheted blanket around you and do a deadpan voiceover: "And this... is my blankie. My only friend in the hospital, who doesn't judge me when I poop myself. #IAmBlanket"The comments blow up:"A blanket’s better than these doctors.""This video is my therapy."“Can you make me one of those blankets though?”
	2	“Medical Bingo with a Shotgun” TikTokTikTok Description:Filmed from your hospital bed, the video shows you holding up a medical chart and sarcastically saying: “The doctors have no idea what’s wrong with me, but here’s their bingo card. Small bowel obstruction, maybe? Radiology says gas and diarrhea.” You dramatically throw the chart in the air like it’s confetti.The comments pour in:“Maybe they’ll find your missing kidney in one of those scans.”“They gave me Tums for internal bleeding.”“Someone should play Find the Vein next time.”

The Bathroom Dilemma:
You desperately need to get to the bathroom, but your bed alarm goes off the moment you try to move. You feel humiliated, unable to get any privacy.
	•	Ask for help: Ring the call button and ask the nurse to help you to the bathroom, even though you know it might take a while.Go to: Help, Please
	•	Try to go anyway: You decide to try and make it without help, risking the bed alarm going off.Go to: Risky Escape

Help, Please:
The nurse finally comes, but by the time they arrive, your situation is dire. You have soiled yourself, and there’s no one to help clean up. You feel like you’re drowning in your own shame.

Risky Escape:
You manage to make it to the bathroom on your own, but the bed alarm goes off. The nurse rushes in and shouts at you for not waiting. You’re humiliated but at least you finally have some privacy.

The Humiliating MRI Experience:
After hours of waiting, you're finally wheeled into the MRI room. The tech informs you that you’ll need to undergo a procedure to help the doctors examine your lower colon and rectum. They need to see how your body is functioning, and the solution is a silicone-based gel — inserted into your rectum.
It’s not a cleanse. It's not for "cleaning out" your system. It's simply a contrast gel that they need in place to give them something to image when you try to poop. The goal is to assess any damage to your lower colon and rectum, but it’s done in the most invasive and humiliating way possible.
The procedure is uncomfortable, to say the least. They insert the gel into you, and almost immediately, the pressure builds. You’re told to hold it in until they’re ready for the scan. But the pressure becomes unbearable. You feel like you can’t hold it anymore, and you have to expel the gel — and everything else. They wheel you into the MRI machine, still full of the gel and the contents of your body, to be trapped there while the scan is performed.
You’re left alone in that sterile room, the gel mixing with the mess you’ve just evacuated. The scent in the room is overpowering, a mix of silicone gel and bodily waste. You're trapped in the machine, unable to move, unable to get comfortable. It feels like an eternity.
After what seems like forever, you call out for help, but no one responds. You’re left in your own filth, utterly humiliated. You scream for someone to come back, but it’s as though your voice doesn’t matter.
A male tech eventually hears you. He walks in, eyes avoiding yours, and hands you a packet of wet wipes, offering no extra clothing or sympathy. He turns to leave without saying a word. You attempt to clean yourself with the wet wipes, but it’s barely enough. You have shit in your hair, and you still need a shower, but the hospital denies you that.

Choice: The Uber Refusal
After the MRI, you’re discharged, and they give you paper scrubs to wear. Your clothes are nowhere to be found, and you're left with these barely-holding-together, disposable garments.
You order an Uber, desperate to get home, but when the driver sees you — covered in the unmistakable stench of bodily waste and still in the paper scrubs — he refuses to let you in.
“Ma’am,” he says, wrinkling his nose in disgust. “I can’t let you in my car like this. I’d have to burn my vehicle if you get in.”
You feel a rush of humiliation and frustration. Not only have you been through an invasive, degrading procedure, but now you can’t even get a ride home without being judged and rejected.

Choice: The Rescue
In desperation, you text your partner, even though you know it will flare up his condition. He’s been living with central sensitization for years, but despite that, he always shows up when you need him.
Thirty minutes later, he arrives, ginger ale and emesis bags in hand, ready to help you back into the car. You vomit twice on the way home, but he’s there, supporting you — not just physically, but emotionally, in a way no one else has.
You both know the struggle. He understands. The journey home feels like a long, slow ride of nausea, pain, and discomfort, but at least you have him by your side. He’s been through his own battles and still, he’s there for you when everything else falls apart.
